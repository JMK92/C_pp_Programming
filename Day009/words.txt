yesterday
all 
my 
troubles 
seemed 
so 
far 
away
now 
it 
looks 
as 
though 
they're 
here 
to 
stay
oh, 
I 
believe 
in 
yesterday

suddenly
i'm 
not 
half 
the 
man 
I 
used 
to
be
there's 
a 
shadow 
hanging 
over 
me
oh, 
yesterday 
came 
suddenly

why 
she 
had 
to 
go
i 
don't 
know, 
she 
wouldn't 
say
i 
said 
something 
wrongs
now 
I 
long 
for
yesterday

yesterday
love 
was 
such 
an 
easy 
game 
to 
play
now 
I 
need 
a 
place 
to 
hide 
away
oh, 
I 
believe 
in 
yesterday

why 
she 
had 
to 
go
i 
don't
know, 
she 
wouldn't 
say
i 
said 
something 
wrong
now 
I 
long 
for 
yesterday

yesterday
love 
was 
such 
an 
easy 
game 
to 
play
now 
I 
need 
a 
place 
to 
hide 
away
oh, 
I 
believe 
in 
yesterday
